## 👩🏻‍💻 Coursera Meta Frontend 👩🏻‍💻

This repository contains my coursework for the Coursera Meta Frontend Developer Certification. It specifically includes my final project, an HTML & CSS only assignment that underwent peer review as part of the certification process.

## 📍 Project Overview 📍

The project revolves around "Mangata & Gallo," a jewelry company. The goal was to create a portfolio website for Mangata & Gallo that showcases their products and contact details. I acknowledge that the repository might seem a bit rough around the edges—it's been some time since I've worked with plain HTML and CSS, so it may appear somewhat basic.

##  🖥️ Contents 🖥️

- `index.html`: The primary HTML file for the portfolio website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the website.
